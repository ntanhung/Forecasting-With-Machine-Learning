# Forecasting-With-Machine-Learning
This project used the data on Kaggle that contained 187 factor columns and 1 target column. The goal is to train a model that can predict the target column. Here, I have used the sklearn library with XGBClassifier model from xgboost library. The result was evaluated on Mean Classification Accuracy (MCA).
