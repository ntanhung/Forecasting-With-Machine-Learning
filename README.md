# Forecasting-With-Machine-Learning
This project used the data on Kaggle that had two datasets: train.csv and test.csv. The training dataset contained 187 factor columns and 1 target column. The goal is to train a model that can predict the target column. Here, I have used the sklearn library with the XGBClassifier model from xgboost library. The result was evaluated on Mean Classification Accuracy (MCA). Then, the model was used to predict the target column for the testing dataset and was submitted to Kaggle. The MCA was 0.97907.
